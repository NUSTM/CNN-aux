stars truly excellent documentary stunning visuals shows really happened during operation iraqi freedom impressive first appear reviewers gave wonderful dvd low ratings either incredibly uninformed world live leftist anti american activists whatever their excuse their reviews misleading best seems clear none them watched dvd isn t issue opinion issue integrity explain mean later review while agree soldiers served iraq might find boring but only few very thorough dvd enough action explanation events truly historical significance way documentaries only dream few soldiers might find boring probably feel way due fact showing video power utility linemen their jobs power utility linemen wouldn t particularly exciting unless bloopers big mistakes documentary fortunately baghdad excellent documentary dvd doesn t show american servicemen blown nor show them riddling terrorists bullets blood spraying either it however excellent job shedding light activities servicemen harm s way entire point us haven t served iraq which us impressively thorough truly cool documentary while dvd extras aren t impressive offer people call boring disingenuous not mention blatantly dishonest vast majority people someone isn t very familiar military gives valuable insight lives active duty troops overseas familiar way american war machine operates informative quite interesting quite relief see american servicemen portrayed not demonized la fahrenheit i strongly recommend seen michael moore s dishonest documentary watch fahrenhype or celsius counterbalance only used leftist american media find boring subpar isn t nearly biased against america nightly news broadcasts fact dvd shows iraqis celebrating streets upon americans arrival baghdad something vast majority liberals deny ever happened keep public discovering re looking hack job denigrating servicemen pretty upset seeing documentary contains truth without nearly left wing spin al jazeera bbc cnn abc cbs nbc msnbc npr nyt lat wp mainstream media outlets liberal activist means highly offensive almost offensive fox news channel lol now dvd stunning visuals begins president bush addressing u n shows preparations war training troops shows saddam s atrocities shows president bush s ultimatum saddam sons leave iraq within hours shows troops waiting anxiously receive their orders surprising confidence youngest soldiers discusses rumsfeld doctrine war strategy controversy using special forces few regular troops vs powell doctrine leftists hate dvd reminds them president bush over approval ratings shows him leading us war remove murderous saddam hussein regime having amazing success this dvd includes nice dose shock awe amazing precise american gps bombs republican palace absolutely decimated inside completely gutted while exterior largely undamaged sidewalks outside clear rubble debris only smoke damage near broken windows makes obvious first glance happened inside shows nice balance daytime nighttime activity lot special forces night vision footage rescue pfc jessica lynch fact dvd pays surprising amount respect special forces nice little teaser get interested learning special ops forces the progress u s military stunning troops advanced rapidly baghdad supply lines strung dangerous degree fortunately didn t lose very lives due fact lost hundred people billions dollars equipment saddam able attack supply lines effectively dvd gives excellent varied perspectives happenings involved coalition forces taking iraq capital baghdad civilians getting caught crossfire failing stop checkpoints later found carrying ak s etc iraqis celebrating americans arrival baghdad once feel confident saddam s henchmen won t step shadows mow them down supporting america cool see footage newsrooms refused air imagine really upsets liberals see bit truth undisputable video footage this dvd shows year dust storm engulfed iraq during beginning stages assault shows american naval forces clearing mines harbors using dolphins american naval vessels launching cruise missiles f a hornets super hornets f s f as thunderbolt iis ac spectre gun ships b stealth bombers b b lancer bombers b bombers rq predator drones ma abrams tanks ma bradleys humvees w mounted tow anti tank missiles machine guns amphibious assault vehicles jdams cruise missiles awacs jstars planes refueling tankers blackhawk apache helicopters etc etc oh lots explosions s quite entertaining unlike hollywood s creations s real it tells story helicopter pilot officer lost blackhawk going down during war devotes respectable amount covering aspect war surprisingly fair although doesn t show leftists america protesting fallen heroes funerals spewing their vitriol hate against military families least treats deaths american servicemen respect imho really stays away politics refreshing organization national geographic whose documentaries routinely parrot leftist propaganda re scientific studies a lighter moment amazing documentary touches iraqi information minister mohammed sayeed al sahaf denying reality make liberals uncomfortable obvious reasons near end shows celebrations where saddam s statue toppled iraqis with help american marines traffic circle cant remember name ends brief review documentary contains surprising amount real footage the entire documentary real war footage minutes talking heads commenting interspersed dvd hope find review helpful gaining understanding truly top notch documentary action movie not comes close adrenaline moments documentary exciting informative entertaining enlightening not mention very done stars awarded dvd very earned
