pros sam elliot singing extras thought cons everything s going year ve seen dozens family movies new old ve seen only worth mentioning re incredible movies cat returns balto going family movie now though m not expecting barnyard didn t help mind set d like tell disappointed s exactly expecting part least didn t expect rip off lion king s sure s not whole lot barnyard really bad say first trailers saw almost years made seem like d cool lil movie originally called boy tipping looked like movie farm animals getting back humans tease them regular basis happened considering final product turned t blame them not showing trailers like bad recent family movie happy feet things get boring s not worth mentioning now don t think m kid movie hater m not not bit t see anyone without vision hearing problems enjoy barnyard why thing even get list actors provide voices man hope kevin james gets good roles soon we start meeting crew farm held together quite ben cow s tall dark beefy bovine takes coyotes try feast farm folk never let single animal get harmed watch son otis doesn t seem like care s young cow looking party good buddies skip farm meeting go hill surfing night though ben overwhelmed coyotes passes away right before son otis elected new head farm thinks t handle goes care free ways entire farm turns constant party even invite pizza delivery guys barn isnt sick cows pigs eating pepperoni though not caring too get caught heck farmer checks them sees them throwing huge party knock him several order fix everything makes middle barnyard s pretty boring few jokes anyone get only later chickens held hostage otis right thing head save them deal coyotes like dad before him you take entire second portion barnyard get results jokes used over over point where think better before s even delivered kept falling asleep opening due lack important funny happening even big musical numbers dull d think rat sunglasses singing shaggy s boombastic great m sure not only moment movie sticks mind almost doesn t even fit movie ben s taking coyotes s holding guitar plays i won t back down tom petty given s sam elliot singing signature deep voice s even beautiful rendition song s great movie almost holds down makes wonder should ve even put first place guess mentioning lion king rip off bit worth going little too lot people claimed barnyard took lion king main plot point where otis didn t want responsibility head farm minor thing compared movies sure fact doesn t want makes agreement head coyote who strongly resembles scar seals deal honestly re better off showing kids lion king again really feel sorry kevin james stuck lousy movie seeing incredible stand special sweat small stuff few years knew guy awesome tv series great too lack good movie role choices far ve seen least worried fading before becomes really big name like should the picture transfer looks like taken decent vhs copy cg movies made get great transfer dvd barnyard manages fail department lots focus scenes fuzz even aliasing plague print sound s nice loud though musical numbers sound great at least technical sense lots surround half movie animated flicks i remember commercials boasting special features cool yet once again things don t go like advertisements lead believe commentary mess wasn t good sign extras disc features oedekerk marshal the barnyard crew over place people talking over someone get headache minutes thing talk technical aspects little jokes like never interesting ve come expect oedekerk boogying barn standard featurette fare focusing band made original songs barnyard north mississippi stars seem pretty bored whole experience even during studio footage utter talent short featurette covers voice actors big small s kinda sad see director praise actors them barely lines namely wanda sykes andie macdowell ironically enough get tons during extra got movie top didn t even know courtney cox voice main female cow seeing feels like waste big name actress seems like expecting movie better keeping short featurette streak animator s life probably boring bunch animators stiff keep showing differences between character designs don t look different having interested animation character design long didn t think d saying looking something like boring least method acting kevin james ups things slightly s footage him farm cows trying act like them gain inspiration them get minutes deleted scenes optional commentary wouldn t helped movie left either demi complete animated story board form nick air campaign series little clips totaling minutes mostly trailers guess exclusive nickelodeon lot footage repeated previous featurettes unfortunately usual trailers previews trailer game music videos dvd rom features mostly games before year wasn t heartless regarding family movies seeing disasters now barnyard end way unless something fresh graces dvd player bad news found s going barnyard tv series kevin james left see wanda sykes signed guess lousy animated movie claims victim going roles get quick buck favor watch something go kind family activity instead doesn t involve barnyard haven t seen open season yet pretty promise s better
