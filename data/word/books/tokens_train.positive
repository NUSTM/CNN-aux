strange flowers in spanish la experiencia surrealista toma lugar en la ciudad que aragon la reconstruye estticamente en una potica de la fragmentacin la imaginacin de la ciudad no es de ninguna manera simblica sino que responde al sustrato material de la experiencia fragmentada en el centro de este mundo de cosas est el ms soado de sus objetos la misma ciudad de pars  las imgenes en el surrealismo adquieren un sentido profundamente histrico aun cuando su contexto sea ensoado como naturaleza simblica como bosque de smbolos baudelaire o mitologa moderna por cuanto la historicidad de las imgenes surrealistas son el contenido latente de una realidad transformada en realidad onrica ningn rostro es surrealista en el grado en que lo es el verdadero rostro de la ciudad las imgenes son las alegoras ensoadas de la ciudad en el cual se proyecta la melancola y el mundo fragmentado de la calle el paysan de paris proveniente del campo la ciudad no es un simple recurso narrativo pone en evidencia la diferencia entre ambos contextos de experiencia que servir de fuerte contraste y excelente ejemplo del cambio que sufri la consciencia esttica en el siglo xix el tiempo de los passages esto es la transicin de una esttica basada en la naturaleza con kant y el romanticismo hacia una esttica del artificio que parte con baudelaire hacia los surrealistas pasando por mallarm rimbaud valry y los simbolistas aragon comienza su libro con un prefacio una nueva mitologa una mitologa moderna que desprecia toda certeza cartesiana del conocimiento y aboga por una primaca de la imaginacin puesto que la razn descansa para aragn en el error fundamental de que la realidad es la certeza la evidencia partir de aqu el error se define con relacin esta pretensin de evidencia que es al mismo tiempo pretensin de autonoma subjetiva cette ombre de laquelle il prtend se passer pour dcrire la lumiere c est l erreur avec ses caracteres inconnus l erreur qui seule pourrait tmoigner celui qui l aurait envisage de la fugitive realit lerreur s accompagne de certitude l erreur s impose par l evidence et tout ce qui se dit de la verit qu on le dise de l erreur ne se trompera pas davantage il n y aurait pas d erreur sans le sentiment meme de l evidence sans lui ne s arreterait jamais l erreursin embargo la razn est habitada por flores extraas que corresponden con los errores de los sentidos admirables jardins des croyances absurdes des pressentiments des obsessions et des dlires donde nacen para aragon dioses desconocidos que excepcin de los antiguos son susceptibles al tiempo pertenecen al mundo profano de la historia humana donde des mythes nouveaux naissent sous chacun de nos pas este es el reino de la imaginacin donde ella no se ocupa no ms del pensamiento y de la afirmacin de la subjetividad sino de estas transformaciones despreciadas la imaginacin surrealista es el origen de la mitologa moderna pero es una mitologa que es autoconsciente y que va en contra del pretendido desencantamiento de la cultura moderna ah est su actualidad histrica la surrealidad consciente es simplemente una respuesta objetiva al reencantamiento del mundo social de la industria que no se piensa como tal sino que de acuerdo con max weber es pura racionalizacin entzauberung ms precisamente la visin surrealista pone en evidencia el carcter encantado del mundo capitalista su reactivacin de los poderes mticos la mitologa moderna de aragon es precisamente transformar mediante su potica de la ensoacin y su concepcin del azar objetivo l hasard objectif el mundo racionalizado en un mundo mtico de la misma manera que adorno y horkheimer hicieron filosficamente en la dialektik der aufklrung la imaginacin de esta manera trasciende la subjetividad racionalizadora y revela mediante sus correspondencias con los objetos realidades y puntos de vista susceptibles de ser utilizados como elementos crticos el contexto urbano de la obra surrealista revela primero una perspectiva diferente de la imaginacin que no puede ser explicada partir de trminos simblicoso metafricos segundo un contexto de experiencia diferente el urbano que no instituye una esttica de la serenidad y del desinters esto es una esttica moral kant sino una esttica del shock poltica vanguardista y tercero una depotenciacin del sujeto potico autnomo de s mismo que incluye una depotenciacin de la bondad de la naturaleza que ya no dicta de ninguna manera las reglas al genio este contexto urbano afecta la perspectiva de la imaginacin de dos maneras primero que la imaginacin al ensoar la ciudad como mitologa precisamente revela lo ms objetivo de la realidad la fantasmagora de la mercanca que se abstrae de toda relacin social de trabajo y que precisamente la racionalidad objetivante de las estructuras sociales modernas se transforman en lo ms subjetivo y arbitrario el encantamiento que trae consigo el progreso y el consumo basado en los escritos de max weber ha sido lugar comn en teora social decir que la esencia de la modernidad es la desmitificacin y el desencantamiento del mundo social sin embargo basado tambin en la visin surrealista podemos decir que la industrializacin ha trado un reencantamiento del mundo social la surrealidad como veremos es implcitamente objetiva y crtica porque implica un reencantamiento de esta clase de mundo es paradjica porque mediante la ensoacin y el mito propio de la experiencia surrealista se pone en evidencia precisamente el carcter encantado y mtico del mundo capitalista y esta ambigedad la puede llevar con todo us rigor la imaginacin lo ms subjetivo la imaginacin surrealista revela lo ms objetivo la naturaleza mitolgica de la industria y lo ms objetivo la estructura racionalizada de la sociedad de mercado revela lo ms subjetivo y fantasmagrico la naturaleza encantada de la mercanca donde se abstrae toda relacin social de mercado us objetividad fantasmtica marx mediante el mismo ensueo ocurre una depotenciacin del sujeto del entendimiento autnomo mediante el privilegio de la imaginacin que revela paradjicamente mejor la objetividad las tres variaciones anteriores una perspectiva nueva de la imaginacin procedente del contexto especfico de experiencia de la ciudad que implica una esttica del shock que desvaloriza la unidad racional desinteresada y contemplativa del sujeto podemos unirlas en la tesis que es la vez de este ensayo de que la constitucin de las imgenes en el surrealismo por ms digmoslo subjetiva y mtica que sea es paradjicamente muy objetiva e histrica esto de dos maneras una en cuanto que la imaginacin es la base para instaurar la fragmentacin del sujeto mediante la ensoacin potica y segundo que la imaginacin en correspondencia con el objeto revela dimensiones desconocidas de ste y que es por tanto ms objetiva en cuanto no existe una primaca del sujeto sobre el objeto mediante el concepto ms objetiva la imaginacin que la razn porque sta ltima usa el objeto para tener certeza de s misma el objeto es el medio de la autoconocimiento de la razn que al final se desecha por irrelevante de esta manera la imaginacin llevada cabo en el contexto ciudadano revela dimensiones fantsticas debido la esencial extraeza en que el sujeto se pone frente lo urbano estas dimensiones fantasmagricas onricas sirven al mismo tiempo para establecer una visin mtica de la ciudad y la modernidad misma que destruyen la visin comn de la modernidad como tiempo de la razn la treta de este mundo de cosas consiste de permutar la mirada histrica sobre lo que ya ha sido por la poltica  la imaginacin tiene en este sentido un potencial crtico mayor que la racionalidad este pasaje de los reflejos y representaciones analogas y correspondencias recuerdan extraamente en los surrealistas una actitud medieval en la introduction au discours sur le peu de realit sugiere breton que el realismo filosfico de la edad media est la base de la experiencia potica pero ese realismo su fe por tanto en una existencia aparte de los conceptos ya fuera ya dentro de las cosas ha encontrado siempre muy rpidamente el trnsito del reino conceptual lgico al reino mgico de las palabras la progresiva depotenciacin de la naturaleza en la esttica postromntica del siglo xix coincide con un progresivo desmontaje del sujeto potico en la concepcin artstica ya hegel haba abandonado el canon de la belleza de la naturaleza propio de la esttica kantiana para afirmar que la belleza artstica artificial es una encarnacin superior de la idea que la belleza natural la ltima etapa de la belleza natural en la esttica de lo sublime desemboca en una esttica de lo maravilloso con baudelaire baudelaire posteriormente transforma la enemistad de la naturaleza en una esttica del culto lo artificial y da con esto en el comienzo de una poesa de la industria el concepto negativo de naturaleza en esta poca est ya presupuesto en la determinacin moderna del arte como anti physis tanto en baudelaire como en marx y valry lo que implica una prdida de la obligatoriedad ejemplar de ella que ya solo sirve para la imaginacin de nuevos mundos este giro en la valoracin de la naturaleza lo marca paradigmticamente el giro del campo la ciudad travs de la industrializacin y por tanto el contexto de experiencia humana cambia cualitativamente por el lado del sujeto potico ste ya no encuentra su propia autoafirmacin en correspondencia con la natura naturans en la unidad romntica del yo y la naturaleza sino que la nueva esttica est acompaada de nuevos miedos y experiencias de alienacin en el anonimato del mundo industrial por lo cual el poeta tiene que recurrir su interioridad imaginativa que implica un escape de la objetividad mediante la ensoacin y la ebriedad el recuerdo se actualiza involuntariamente mediante asociaciones espontneas fortuitas como postul por otro lado proust el sueo y el recuerdo son las memorias involuntarias de esta manera la experiencia surrealista del entorno est ubicada afuera de la voluntad o del entendimiento no es una decisin propia de un sujeto autnomo sino de la pura imaginacin tout relve de l imagination et de l imagination tout rvle la imaginacin subordinada al entendimiento o la voluntad no existe en el surrealismo y de esta manera se vuelve absolutamente autnomo del sujeto pero no del entorno es la ensoacin del entorno porque no hay imaginacin sin percepcin de esta manera podemos llegar la afirmacin de que la imaginacin mejor que las imgenes son absolutamente objetivas no dependen de nuestra inteligencia discours de l imaginationaujourdhui je vous apporte un stupfiant venu des limites de la conscience des frontires de l bime qu avezvous cherch jusqu ici dans les drogues sinon un sentiment de puissance une mgalomanie menteuse et les libres exercice de vos facults dans le vide le produit que j ai l honneur de vous prsenter procure tout cela procure aussi d inmenses avantages inespers dpasse vos dsirs les suscite vous fait accder des dsirs nouveaux inmenss le vice appel surrealisme est l emploi drgl et passionel du stupfiant image ou plutot de la provocation sans controle de l image pour elle meme et pour ce qu elle entraine dans le domaine de la reprsentation de perturbations imprvisibles et de mtamorphoses car chaque image chaque coup vous force rviser tout l universla imagen constituye un golpe como de golpes es de dnde ella precede en el contexto de lo urbano y en este sentido se diferencia de la serenidad desinteresada propio de lo simblico justamente proveniendo de la velocidad urbana la imagen que se manifiesta involuntariamente es el modo de asociacin con el entorno donde un sujeto autoconsciente no est ms la base de la percepcin asimismo la imagen surrealista reclama una transformacin de la praxis vital de los receptores y niega toda actitud desinteresada ante el arte la analoga en el plano de la produccin y recepcin artsticas es evidente mientras que la ciudad o en el plano esttico la obra de arte se constituye tambin como shock estmulo velocidad en la recepcin la imagen tambin es shock cuestiona toda esfera vital y obliga fuerza revisar todo el universo la imagen surrealista es entonces negacin de lo real para constituirse en lo posible fantstico mediante la fantasmagora y la provocacin y que es coherente con el contexto ciudadano moderno de donde surge y al mismo tiempo obliga revisar nuestras concepciones fundamentales de la imaginacin y contemplacin estticas la primera como principio de produccin la segunda de recepcin partir de esta categora central de la imagen presente en el paysan de paris es la base para toda una revisin de la imaginacin y la intuicin fundamental de toda obra vanguardista o de otra manera el concepto de imagen e imaginacin en el surrealismo es la categora central para explicar su carcter de obra vanguardista puesto que la obra vanguardista pertenece al concepto especfico de lo urbano el contexto de experiencia de la modernidad de dnde surge el arte moderno y en especial aqu el surrealismo revela tres caractersticas especficas la novedad el azar el montaje estas tres caractersticas son funden en una cuarta que las engloba en el caso del surrealismo la imagen siendo la imaginacin una cuestin espontnea como el recuerdo involuntario en proust la imagen se revela absolutamente objetiva como objetivos pretendidamente son la novedad el azar y el montaje en las sociedades modernas la imagen es la expresin objetiva de las sociedades modernas como ella pretende ser siempre nueva novedad que se actualiza siempre en el golpe coup las sociedades modernas siempre quieren ser nuevas en la moda como la imagen pretende ser azarosa en las mltiples coincidencias que los surrealistas quieren encontrar en la realidad el correlato estructural es el funcionamiento de las sociedades modernas se basan en una serie de decisiones individuales atomizadas que componen una especie de autoorganizacin disipativa donde no se puede encontrar un estado inicial de cosas al que se pueda referir como causa sino un desorden inicial je vivais au hasard la poursuite du hasard je m abandonnais donc les jours coulaient cette sorte de baccara tournant y finalmente como la imagen funciona mediante montaje es decir mediante la acumulacin inorgnica de emblema por la falta de un sentido objetivo las sociedades funcionan mediante un montaje de instituciones estructuras y mercancas que como el montaje funcionan por el sentido arbitrario que la sociedad les confiere el sueo del paysan es esta arbitrariedad que reviste caracteres mticos por la expresin de la imaginacin pero que sin embargo en ella se anuncia una objetividad sorpresiva il y dans le monde un dsordre impensable et l extraordinaire est qu a leur ordinaire aient recherch sous l apparence du dsordre un ordre mystrieux l esprit de l homme en supporte pas le dsordre parce qu il en peut le penser je veux dire qu il en peut le penser premierement la notion de l ordre n est point compense par la notion inexpugnable du dsordre de esta manera el desorden es objetivo l hasard objectif y la progresiva depotenciacin de la causalidad y racionalidad natural corresponde una actitud subjetiva igualmente azarosa y mltiple es decir desubjetivizada que solo la imaginacin puede cumplir mediante la ensoacin con el fin de dominar los accidentes organizar el pesimismo no es otra cosa que transportar fuera de la poltica la metfora smbolo moral y descubrir en el campo de la accin poltica el mbito de las imgenes de pura cepa  ya valry deca que los accidentes pueden ser causados y el azar se erige como una categora central objetiva para corresponder la imaginacin autnoma del sujeto el descubrimiento de las maravillas de lo cotidiano escribe burger representa evidentemente un enriquecimiento de las posibilidades de experiencia del hombre urbano sin embargo est ligada un tipo de conducta que renuncia las iniciativas en favor de una disposicin universal la impresin los surrealistas no se dan por satisfechos con ella y buscan la provocacin de lo excepcional cmo se constituye este giro tan radical en la concepcin esttica a principios del siglo xix los romnticos alemanes protestando contra el racionalismo ilustrado haban abogado por un renacimiento de la mitologa en lo que schelling haba llamado un nuevo simbolismo universal basado en las cosas de la naturaleza las cuales significan y son al mismo tiempo todo simbolismo debe surgir de la naturaleza y volver ella las cosas de la naturaleza son y significan al mismo tiempo solo en la mitologa hay un verdadero material simblico pero la mitologa misma solo es posible mediante la relacin de sus formas con la naturaleza el renacimiento de la visin simblica de la naturaleza debera ser el primer paso hacia una restitucin de una nueva mitologa en lo simblico de la naturaleza se manifiesta para los romnticos la esencia del fenmeno la totalidad de lo viviente en el siglo xx viendo la propuesta de la mitologa moderna aragoniana la nueva naturaleza de la industria y lo urbano han generado todo el poder mtico que estos romnticos hubieran deseado ahora est la imaginacin potica igual de serena y simblica en el contexto de lo moderno el romanticismo haba asumido que el arte podra ser la fuente de toda regeneracin de lo mitolgico los arquetipos goetheanos la mstica de schlegel el simbolismo de schelling todos estos anclados en el ideal del arte sin embargo la creatividad de la industria que en ese tiempo era considerada como tcnica y no arte es la que en realidad construye en lo moderno todo un mundo mtico de fotografas mercancas diseos industriales etc que reemplazan ese ideal humanista de un genio individual que produce todo un mundo mtico travs del arte kant wagner etc las fuerzas mticas estn presentes en el nuevo mundo de la industria los romnticos queran fundar una nueva mitologa travs de un contramundo campesino preindustrial y tradicional los surrealistas tambin hablan de una nueva mitologa y dieron en el punto porque sera nueva en todo sentido es decir anclada en el nuevo mundo de la industria en vez de ver la cultura tradicional como fuente de inspiracin o como en el neoclasicismo adquiriendo smbolos de mitos antiguos los surrealistas vieron la naturaleza cambiante del paisaje industrial en s misma maravillosa y mtica el paysan de paris vaga intoxicado travs del nuevo paisaje de mercancas como su contraparte campesina vagara por un bosque encantado la torre eiffel le parece al paysan una jirafa el sacre coeur es un ictiosauro los tanques de gasolina en las bombas brillan con el aura de las divinidades ce sont de grands dieux rouges de grands dieux jaunes de grands dieux vertes fichs sur le bord des pistes spculatives que l esprit emprunte d un sentiment l autre les scuplteurs sans nom quui ont elev ces fantomes metalliques se plier une tradition aussi vive que celle qui traait les glises en croix ces idoles ont entre elles une parent qui les rend redoutables bariols de mots anglaises et des mots de cration nouvelle avec un seul bras long et souple une tete lumineuse sans visage le pied unique et le ventre la roue chiffr les distributeurs d essence ont parfois l allure des divinits de l egypte ou de celles des peuplades anthropophages qui n adorent que la guerre o texaco motor oil eco shell grandes inscriptions du potentiel humaine ! bientot nous nous signerons devant vos fontaines et les plus jeunes d entre nous priront d avoir considr leur nymphes dans le naphte ms que el humor y la irona surrealistas el sentimiento de lo moderno en aragon trivializa y vulgariza aquello que es respetable en la cultura y de esta manera lo trivial se vuelve en objeto de respeto para el paysan de aragon lo milagroso emana de los fenmenos ms mundanos como de las peluqueras del passage de l opera le theatre moderne la galerie du barometre los cafs etc lejos de escapar como los romnticos las formas viejas de la cultura la vuelta los griegos de goethe la mitologa germana en wagner la imaginacin surrealista aprehende directamente la esencia metafsica as la llama aragon de las formas modernas il y avait des objets usuels qui n en pas douter participaient pour moi du mystre plongaient dans le mystre il semblait bien que l essence de ces plaisirs fut toute metaphysique il semblait bien qu elle impliqut leur ocassion une sorte de got passion de la rvlation un objet se transfigurait mes yeux il en prenait point l allure allgorique ni le caractre du symbole lo que distingue estos nuevos dioses de los anteriores como dijimos es que estos son transitorios pertenecen un mundo absolutamente profano donde sus poderes tambin son transitorios la transitoriedad de este nuevo mundo mtico funda un poder y una relacin imaginativa absolutamente nueva ya la imaginacin simblica es incapaz de asociarse con este nuevo mundo donde el devenir es us principio de poder puesto que el smbolo est ms ocupado con captar la eternidad de la idea esttica la imagen surrealista es un flash que puede cambiar tan rpido como el mundo de ah que el conocimiento y la poesa para aragon sea algo absolutamente concreto descends dans ton ide habite ton ide puisatier pendu ta corde la transitoriedad de estos dioses no son simblicas son terrenas il m apparut que l homme est plein de dieux comme une ponge inmerge en plein ciel ces dieux vivent l apoge de leur force puis meurent laissant d autres dieuxleurs autels parfums ils sont les principes mmes de toute transformation de toute ils sont la necessit du mouvement je promenai donc avec ivresse au milieu de mille concrtions divines je mis concevoir une mythologie en marche elle mritait proprement le nom de mythologie moderne je l imaginais sous ce nom la racionalidad instrumetal propia del conocimiento y la tcnica reprime algo que la imaginacin expresa que el nuevo mundo de la tcnica tambin es mtico lo que cambia por completo la consideracin tradicional de que la imaginacin es la subjetividad y la interioridad propi

fascinating albeit incomplete reorient important works last decade not only challenges dominant perspective western social science refutes author s colleagues earlier arguments andre gunder frank lays down central arguments reorient complement rise west not happen due internal factors predicated american silver asian market asia general china particular center global economy th century thus frank aims destroy bases eurocentrism social sciences frank argues europe not important figure world economy th century asians productive competitive europeans asia remained center global economy industrial revolution throughout period european nations constantly trade deficits asian nations particularly china india indication european trade deficit gold silver never less thirds total european exports p new world silver reason very important europeans helped them cover their trade deficits asians become active player asian economy thus frank contends american silver bought europeans ticket asian productive commercial train steaming ahead already established track p one frank s original arguments regarding superiority chinese economy vis vis european economy th th century different effects economies influx new world silver make case frank utilizes fisher s famous quantity price equation maintains increase amount money economy result increases prices goods unless matched increase quantity goods p frank demonstrates whereas american silver caused substantial increases price goods europe not remarkable inflationary effect chinese economy happen chinese production increased parallel increase amount silver means massive arrival new american money stimulated production asia europe pp according frank situation attests higher productivity chinese economy compared european economy thus frank refutes orthodox eurocentric hoarding argument china assumed chinese used american european silver large non economic unproductive ways primarily jewelry asians earned money first industrious productive begin additional money generated asian demand production p another historical fact frank uses demonstrate superiority asian economies over european economies per capita production economies th th century using estimates prominent historians braudel bairoch frank shows asians accounted percent world population produced percent total world output contrast europe constituted percent world population produced only part remaining percent again means average asians significantly productive europeans p fist case franks reasoning simple smart convincing after economic comparisons frank concludes europeans not create world economic system purchased existing american silver therefore asserts the rise west derived prior contemporaneous development the rest p prospectsthe principal importance reorient lies demolishing bases eurocentrism theories explain the rise west factors internal europe theories attributed european economic development europe s exceptionality factors rationality religion science geographic location yet frank demonstrates europe not inherent superiority th through th century vis vis asia asian nations least rational industrial capitalist dynamic european thus no european head start exceptionality necessitate creation european hegemony over others american silver asian market allowed rise west frank s arguments change central question dealt regarding rise west critical question no why west rose th century because not why west rose late th early th century frank argues new question not mere difference begs qualitatively different answer what makes reorient particularly important not only destroys myth european exceptionalism uncovers refutes eurocentrism critics theories frank argues important critics capitalist world economy marx braudel wallerstein not escape eurocentrism embedded theories criticized either while marx viewed asian nations stagnant traditional inferior wallerstein assigned insignificant role asia mediterranean making modern world system p frank views arguments mere assumptions refutes them ways first tries demonstrate europe not inherent superiority th through th century vis vis asia second frank argues europe owe future rise borrowing integration established asian economy thus frank demonstrates europe not create world system incorporated rest world wallerstein argued rather integrated asian market climbed back asia pp problemsunfortunately frank s novel theorizing turns expense conceptual clarity frank s approach world economy modes production renders important concepts like world system capitalism ambiguous frank argues one world economy system own structure dynamic p frank s view existence trade relations between regions world create world system thus frank equates global trade world system however th century trade highly regionalized regions miniscule contacts others frank himself notes europeans role asian trade before second half th century insignificant europe accounted only percent asian nations international trade pp thus define world system global economic system parts world economically dependent side wallerstein argued system not exist th century the rise future demise world capitalist system essential wallerstein p indeed although unintentionally frank provide support point notes europeans first operate markets simultaneously systematically integrate activities between them p only world system far unfortunately european a subsequent problem results frank s bias towards holistic analysis search single centers world economy frank argues entire world economy sinocentric th century p however doubts regarding china s central role economies european middle eastern countries period history throughout th th centuries ottomans persians central middle eastern economies chinese similarly period british dutch central european economy chinese therefore tend agree pomeranz later stated pre world a polycentric world no dominant center the great divergence p another shortcoming frank s book cannot adequately account rise west late th early th centuries argument asian economies altogether facing kondratieff b cycle first half th century allowed europe finally outdo asians therefore asserts the fall asia preceded european political military intervention asian nations pp first problem might argument impressionistic allows little room human agency fundamental problem however frank s account not consider possibility asian economic decline first half th century temporary problem asian economies easily recovered not european military intervention indeed frank himself reports average annual exports asia dutch british east india companies declined decades s s but recovered s p frank notes throughout th century balance trade between britain china constantly china s favor british reverse situation only through forced opium trade th century thus contra frank believe asian economic problems th century not insurmountable the fall asia indeed european creation not satisfying answer why europe outdid asians
