research theory construction book s title shows qualitative research primary subject developing grounded theory secondary subject opposite true case book coauthored earlier strauss the discovery grounded theory strategies qualitative research interval between writing books strauss may realized thesis research work theory construction text second book too presents research work theory construction explained below thought called theory linguistic issue definition term not prevent construction real theories distinct empirical knowledge in lieu implicit definition theory appeared earlier book p explicit given second book a set developed concepts related through statements relationship together constitute integrated framework used explain predict phenomena p new critical obscure expressions definition well developed concepts integrated framework whereas idea explaining predicting phenomena using theory appeared earlier definition mentioned review earlier book explaining predicting phenomena done using empirical knowledge too therefore cannot considered distinguishing characteristic theories example empirical laws electromagnetism known before maxwell served explain predict control electromagnetic phenomena not constitute theory authors repeat mistake admit a theory set empirical findings continue saying it offers explanation phenomena p say generating theories phenomena rather generating set findings important development field knowledge pp correct problem know theories generated findings too serve explain phenomena mentioned although narrower scope theories statements relationship between phenomena commonly referred hypotheses p any hypotheses propositions derived data continuously checked against incoming data modified extended deleted necessary p key concept authors not clarify sufficiently derivation hypotheses data first relationships between phenomena deduced data thus produced constitutes not hypothesis empirical knowledge phenomena relationships generalized through induction newton s words become general rules hypothetical nature hypotheses induction yields only probabilities not certainties bertrand russell emphasized authors seem ignore fact moreover hypotheses thus derived data continuously checked against incoming data modified extended deleted necessary conserved finally supported new information stop hypotheses become empirically known facts set facts constitutes empirical knowledge not theory the authors seem not clear view where induction deduction used anytime researcher derives hypotheses data involves interpretation consider deductive process p relationship deduced data related singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge phenomena hypothesis created knowledge generalized through induction total process not only deduction involves induction authors express facts obscure way thus at heart theorizing lies interplay making inductions deriving concepts their properties dimensions data deductions hypothesizing relationships between concepts relationships derived data data abstracted analyst raw data p authors unclearly describe abstracted analyst raw data newton meant words generalized through induction generalization cover phenomena not allow deduction hypothesis data hypothesis expected used construct theory authors conclude at end hoped researcher systematically developed products analysis theory p major mistake conception theory construction ignores following fact hypothesis checked against incoming data ie fits data deducible data no hypothesis empirical knowledge therefore system statements only hypotheses constitutes not theory group empirical knowledge authors repeat mistake say theory is validated during actual research process validated during actual original research process empirical knowledge second phase research concerned validation theory e showing consequences theory fit phenomena deducible not only theory phenomena consequently theory becomes usable explaining predicting controlling phenomena only knowledge deduced readily obtained raw data related singular phenomena generalized through induction assumed hypothesized valid relation phenomena not make possible deduction hypothesis data hypothesis created used construct theory means theory contains least hypothesis cannot deduced empirical data related phenomena assumed apply reason law nature may deduced data related phenomena not data related phenomena consequently transferring knowledge set phenomena provide hypothetical knowledge otherwise unavailable theory set general statements laws least non testable hypothesis construction theory theory thus constructed consequences deduced serve explain predict control related phenomena usefulness theory things constitutes proof usability proofs contents non testable hypothesis hypotheses phenomena not fit tested accepted theory encountered general theory constructed old theory not discarded considered wrong remains area where valid simpler general theory the above presented knowledge content method construction theories derived grand theories physics shown books method used psychology too example constructed theory automatic responses symptoms non organic mental disorders dreams cerebral lateralization structural response etc theory serves not only explain predict phenomena control them very effectively where possible mention best test ideas their usefulness explaining predicting controlling phenomena although strauss corbin advocate call grounded theory reality nothing empirical knowledge expose their distrust their work contains unclear points warn reader saying remember theory theory p theories inspire respect their method construction their function better understood

assassin trail stops feet murderer lee harvey oswald late jim garrison s book on trail assassins large part basis oliver stone s motion picture jfk film containing lies half truths misrepresentations facts surrounding john f kennedy s assassination s literally difficult keep them i cannot watch single scene oliver stone s film without finding distortion evidence real jfk j d tippit murder cases small things distorted great big example among dozens oliver stone s version shoe clerk johnny brewer s testimony re lee harvey oswald s manner dress brewer encountered oswald shortly oswald shot killed policeman tippit stone film oswald gary oldman wearing jacket enters texas theater seen brewer and movie s deleted scenes on dvd version film kevin costner playing garrison even voice over lie re brewer s testimony costner saying brewer man wearing jacket brewer reality exactly opposite during warren commission testimony mr belin will describe man saw mr brewer he little man weighed pounds brown hair brown sports shirt shirt tail mr belin any jacket mr brewer no another interesting part tippit portion movie jfk oliver stone s audio commentary during part film riddled inaccuracies stone audacity spout following lie re tippit shooting dvd s commentary soundtrack not credible witness really identified oswald single shooter of officer tippit fact only significant testimony applies shooters o stonetherefore per mr stone and garrison pretty thing years earlier only credible witness acquilla clemmons far aware only witness ever person involved tippit slaying stone like jim garrison before him simply rather believe own version events rather multiple witnesses never saw shooter with single shooter positively identified oswald witnesses its interesting indeed stone thinks only significant testimony re tippit crime came clemmons whereas people like markham tatum scoggins who closer clemmons scene murder deemed less significant merely no doubt don t fit stone s or garrison s ct landscape surrounding murder i wonder people realize outright lies contained oliver stone s hour minute motion picture number simply staggering number distortions increased considerably dvd version film audio commentary track mr stone deleted extended scenes included and great deal deliberate misinformation put forth movie screen came directly book authored jim garrison another great place see mr garrison s skewed views jfk case read garrison s playboy magazine interview like stone s movie playboy article keep busy try keep inaccurate things garrison keeps saying lengthy piece whole interview read wwwjfklancercomgarrisonhtmlselected examples mr garrison s paranoia loony toon conspiracy talk taken playboy interview provided via quotes below own rebuttal arguments follow quote though oswald may not known why instructed undoubtedly why got job texas school book depository building conspirators knew place him scene convince world demented marxist real assassin jim garrison the above garrison gem totally distorts or flat out ignores true documented facts oswald got job depository mid october suburban dallas housewives linnie mae randle ruth paine directly responsible placing lee harvey oswald tsbd way ordinary garden variety happenstance garrison therefore believe mrs paine arranged oswald s job interview depository boss roy truly main conspirators setting oswald take fall jfk s murder following month which mean paine detailed knowledge president s motorcade route month before november garrison think roy truly big part patsy plot mr truly hired oswald even though nobody holding shotgun truly s head forcing him hire lee the commonly held belief lee oswald placed texas school book depository evil plotters prior desperate attempt cters like mr garrison attach unprovable unsupportable conspiratorial strings random event involved several individuals individuals whose collective synchronized actions not possibly foreseen controlled group behind thescenes conspirators anyone takes read warren report find witnesses dealey plaza able assess origin shots almost thirds came grassy knoll area front right presidential limousine not book depository jim garrison this pure nonsense indeed several witnesses heard shots coming front jfk s car garrison severely skewed stats support claim knoll shooters almost thirds figure not even close accurate talking number witnesses heard frontal shots even amongst cters virtually no pro conspiracy author ever rigged stats ofwhack manner the fact half earwitnesses heard shots coming direction book depository not knoll even illuminating statistic reveals less earwitnesses heard shots single general location front vs rear stat speaks volumes because even cters admit rear shots an interesting tabulation data found below httpmcadamsposcmueduimagesshotsjpghttpmcadamsposcmueduearwitnesseshtmthe second shot struck president back location wound verified not consulting official autopsy report perusing reports filed fbi agents present president s autopsy stated unequivocally bullet question entered president kennedy s back not continue through body jim garrison therefore mr garrison essence saying likely trust word fbi agents who course not doctors not conducting president s autopsy rather take word physicians signed official autopsy report why believe autopsy doctors trust gospel word bystander sarcasm alert plus why didn t fbi agents get conspirators memo cters right success patsy plot passed nearly everyone officialdom memo probably attn agents re framing oswald tomorrow remember falsify evidence humanly possible ensure conviction patsy evidently people needed see never received important document we located man not involved shooting created diversionary action order distract people s attention snipers individual screamed fell ground simulated epileptic fit drawing people away vicinity knoll before president s motorcade reached ambush point jim garrison yet outright lie lips district attorney garrison man called simulated epileptic fit fully identified fbi may name jerry belknap man history epilepsy childhood belknap proved fbi paid ambulance bill taken parkland hospital president kennedy killed reason working reconciliation u ssr castro s cuba assassins group fanatic anti communists fusion interests preventing kennedy achieving peaceful relations communist world jim garrison any solid verifiable proof accusations mr garrison physical evidence whatsoever shows jfk killed gun answers questions no no but lack physical evidence never stopped hard boiled cter thats proven over over again vast assortment conspiracists theories their sleeve dog fleas in summation least shots fired president front rear least gunmen assisted several accomplices stage events lee harvey oswald no spectator assassination perhaps very literal sense james altgens snapped picture shows man remarkable resemblance oswald standing doorway depository altgens photograph indicates very real possibility moment oswald supposed shooting kennedy may standing outside front door watching motorcade don t believe oswald shot anybody november nd not president not tippit jim garrison it seems though devilishly clever conspirators forgot important thing setting lho forgot their brains brains allow their lone patsy casually drift outside photographed seen countless witnesses plotters need lee harvey th floor per mr garrison s account oswald possibly doorway man evidently real assassins indeed brainless lacked common sense keep oswald where wouldn t able establish credible alibi whereabouts just think garrison remarks moment longer too at least shots fired president front rear least gunmen doesnt shooter shot patsy assassination plot seem bit unlikely anyone writer professional killers attempt frame lone fall guy type overkill fashion opinion no pro hit men go complicated task setting oswald or anybody needlessly reckless way a single pro hit man easily killed jfk shots probably oswald s nest without need clog works needless back up gunmen hiding around dealey plaza there no possible way conspirators ensured success multi shooter plot frame oswald minutes during shooting no way way too uncontrollable factors block success patsy venture jim garrison placed faith uncontrollable items frontal shooter might very seen witnesses and think witness sun easily bought taken care or coerced plotters again too wishful thinking conspirators part imo frontal shooter might strike occupants car strike somebody dealey plaza even only kennedy hit frontal gunman massive problems corrected conspirators bullets hidden course knows obvious frontal wounds victim somehow eliminated eliminated immediately before non conspirators spill beans only person straight booby hatch believe anyone regardless power pull get away thing s plain loony patsy oswald easily pure accident happenstance established perfect alibi himself supposed th floor shooting president as mr garrison apparently think occurred oswald seen photo taken bullets flying even though reasonable researchers know full doorway man billy lovelady not oswald lovelady even testified effect plus oswald really doorway why earth didn t say s got ironclad alibi like why wouldn t instead says not word outside steps even tells police provable lie re whereabouts the lie having lunch junior jarman shooting sense make oswald really depository doorway and very fact oswald not usable provable alibi exactly pm absolutely remarkable really wandering around lower floors depository or outside building cters firmly believe even rabid conspiracy theorists got admit ctpatsy pov oswald s not having usable believablesolid alibi certainly far biggest piece luck whole patsy plot these amazing patsy plotters lucked evidently oswald not seen single person inside outside tsbd precisely assassination except howard brennan ron fischer robert edwards course saw oswald nicely arranged oswald imposter sniper s nest seconds before likelihood non tsbd bullets going somehow get swept rug extremely remote especially bob groden like scenario mr groden per book the killing president incredibly zero shots coming oswald window total ten shots fired and them coming rifles rifle idiot plotters going attempt frame oswald ! groden s scenario reckless preposterous doubt biggie cters evidently don t think ever happened before november nd patsy mr lho get wise plot brewing around him take measures guarantee never blamed actual assassination john kennedy when thinking frame lee oswald patsy plan cannot visualize professional assassins even minute contemplating multiple shooters let alone gunmen firing grassy knoll e exact opposite direction where their single dupe supposed located as previously mentioned quotes mouth mr garrison amply demonstate anyone desire set on trail lunatic conspiracy theorist look no further earling carothers jim garrison

murray rothbard equivalent saying popes austrian view private property pillar society nonsense according rothbard error thomists classical natural law theorists viewed state major locus virtuous

views inseparable economic theory state exists solely destroy fruits market cf man economy state the supreme irony dr woods continues defend compatibility austrianism catholicism even against

used purposively men moral consideration s precisely ethical cast mises austrians sought banish economics church claimed right decide moral lights should guide christians formulating economic order woods not meditate upon question whether moral calculus laws state passes regulate exchange goods relations between labor capital mentor rothbard already taught state criminal nature follows decrees

little knowledge dangerous thing books commented book review assignment korean history class taught very very renowned professor korean history got a review professor especially argeed comments triplett s book disagree previous reviews amazon which reason chose read book big waste sadly want leave review future reader s reference rogue state nuclear north korea threatens america although written former chief republican counsel senate foreign relations committee william triplett ii overall disappointing book triplett accuses north korea proliferating weapons supporting terrorism producing selling drugs abusing human rights kidnapping females sex slaves although triplett provides detailed allegations facts not give credible unbiased sources allegations greatly weakens claim moreover presents north korea dangerous state world accuses china planning behind supporting militarily economically politically almost sixty years hidden intension north korea borrowed knife kill people p contrary suggested title triplett not spend analysis north korea nuclear crisis potential outcomes everything goes argues fails give constructive recommendations only predicting issues north korea nuclear weapons particular not progress unless u s define issue not north korea communist china north korea p yet america already tried involve china solving north korea nuclear crisis triplett borrows phrase killing borrowed knife chinese military classic stratagems presents strategy secret doctrine chinese people according him means to covertly country annihilate enemy p however apparently not fully understand meaning phrase triplett says make stratagem work disguised keeping opponent learning vital information denial misleading him true intentions deception therefore argues china north korea adopting strategy denial deception trying hide their malicious aggressive intensions p however interpretation stratagem completely wrong true make stratagem work disguise intentions yet disguise not only opponent importantly borrowed knife point strategy deceive someone make him fight against opponent let person bear costs china north korea indeed made secret agreement triplett suggests goes directly against strategy therefore triplett cannot reach point china north korea using denial deception claiming try kill borrowed knife triplett goes spend quarter book history role stalin s soviet union mao s red china played during korean war demonstrate their close connection north korea triplett gives list records soviet s china s involvement north korea p without providing source allegation puts reader doubts credibility impartiality claim example triplett writes moscow beijing helped kim start korean war beijing intervened block united national victory war p however question started korean war north south debatable impartial view bruce cumings thinks wrong ask started war north south korea fault cumings korea s place sun p cumings argue united nation s decision enter war against north korea solely american south korean sources likely biased cumings p thus accusing china haveing blocked united nation s victory without providing enough background information mislead reader allegation triplett claims communist china helped pyongyang start korean war p accusation apparently false china saw conquering taiwan priority not want korean war divert energy not support idea korean war not help north korea war very late too late military strategy perspective to demonstrate soviet union china north korea produced a series decisions initiated reign terror over millions people far east established framework east asia today triplett claims stalin mao kim decided communist summit late let kim conquer south korea mao conquer tibet taiwan ho chi minh conquer indochina attack japanese communist party p however triplett again fails credit source important decision s see half century none goals materialized except china s takeover tibet aims even never attempted let alone attempted failed therefore even stalin mao kim make secret agreement only goal achieved wonder whether china north korea indeed ability initiate reign terror put billions lives danger triplett claims triplett claims china supports north korea blame making north korea dangerous however triplett fails make clear china s intension incentive support north korea crucial non communist world should respond china may not malicious aims support north korea done partly mao s romanticism help communist friend s once support started hard stop china might support north korea increase own influence international politics without aim north korea dominate world intensions perfectly justified u s supporting various countries regions around world order stake regional politics taiwan japan israeli possibility may china sees trend north korea towards terrorism instability fearing neighboring country getting trouble spillover ensue china may trying prevent social political crisis north korea providing support triplett fail analyze possibilities fact china should countries want see north korea become terrorist state least unless fully control kim jong il triplett fails prove either triplett provides piece evidence against accusation china s involvement himself prove danger north korea says turned income producing selling drugs china cut support fund own economic development regardless amount support china provided north korea assume china evil planner behind north korea right now china already cut support the weakest point triplett s book point view making unaccredited rather controversial claims fails go anywhere significant analysis not really examine implications nuclear tensions argues no simple military solution nuclear north korea solve north korean problem u s define problem not north korea communist china north korea p although triplett claims bush administration blind role communist china shown china played important role negotiating north koreans not case u s not tried make china influence north korea china tried triplett s conclusion not help problem china tried hide influence north korea america even re defines problem wants china move price pay known rule game international politics triplett s suggestion incomplete without recommendation employ china negotiation reasonable price to sure triplett provide examples tries prove connection between china north korea historical perspective however fails give references important examples creditability impartiality book consequently conclusion question readers knowledge korean history easily give alternative explanations examples not lead conclusion besides conclusion not contribute situation right now given triplett s role u s government book important valuable sense it less indicates u s governmental official s perspective north korea dangerously prejudiced perspecitve another minor point triplett should done better selection framing cases example list prices non communist world paid north korea triplett parallels loss americans lives korean war killing high school girl singing chorus shootout killed south korean first lady p no matter cruel killing innocent high school girl way less important significant causality americans korean war putting list gives rise doubts author s capability
