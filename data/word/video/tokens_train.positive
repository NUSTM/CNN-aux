sentinel worth watching spoiler alert rather hard review film without giving away key components don t normally call spoilers reviews case lot themes film film came during glorious era spiritual horror flicks like the exorcist the omen great success films humdinger sadly overlooked truly horrifying film deserves place dvd collection especially specific genre spiritual horror flicks the cast impressive list actors unfortunately beens s coming actors now rather famous christina raines main actress sadly never made big should gives very solid performance rather difficult disturbing film found actors good bit hammy doesn t detract overall impression film fact may bizarre way add considering casting actual freaks forgive political incorrectness term film this film like freak show sorts car accident don t really want see screen t help ourselves enough film revolt infuriate especially s condemnation sins man try accept today over indulgence term tolerance sees odd film keep mind catholic faith s interpretation sin certainly instution not known s tolerance sin inclined whatever feels good life especially point excess may find squirming seat bit while watching film either awkward sense guilt seeing sins kind exposed film anger way life isn t considered acceptable staunch religious no likes someone pointing condemning finger him even may earned natural instinct either feel shame anger even mixture by way mean freak show literally mentioned earlier don t care term film considered themselves grew location no problem term please excuse honestly don t mean rude less make up involved film aware actual circus freaks used film especially climax scene fact dad knew number them part freak show coney island famous amusement park south brooklyn where spent summer day riding cyclone roller coaster occasion dad take bizarre shows park interesting see shows film later able say i know guy young age seeing added oddity film parents obviously far too permissive films let see young saw film came along the exorcist the omen barely teens anyhow grew bensonhurst not too far where filmed movie recall taking pictures actual house where filmed exterior shots unfortunately lost them over years house neighborhood very congested red hook section brooklyn despite directly river bustling manhattan overcrowded section brooklyn intense feeling isolation conveyed film credit goes director michael winner achieving via camera positioning course s experienced shooting new york having directed brilliant death wish charles bronson earlier the whole concept film bit silly weirdly interesting lone priest guards gates hell passes guardianship over someone before death unable gates hell remain open temporarily left ajar during transition sentinel next idea satan played burgess meredith comes keep hell s gates open open wide convince new sentinel commit suicide mortal sin catholic church something main character attempted once before life instead accepting thankless life isolation servitude means redemption past sins as silly premise film t help feel uplifted end sad new sentinel sacrifice made behalf thankless strangers analogy christ s crucifixation life priest nunhood clear notion sinful ugly sadly self centered suicide viewed catholic church outside please spare negative comebacks isn t personal view suicide tend feel god takes great pity not face trials life often brings attempt succeed suicide often distraught not thinking clearly trouble believing god punish troubled soul discussion argument like the exorcist the omen before sadden losses sustained sacrifices made end main characher may not totally noble certainly likable the sentinel alison reluctantly takes role new guardian wanted life already felt god owed something hence suicide attempt earlier yet gives god others spite past pain t help see may offered redemption past mistakes taking burden allowed free not accept although may begrudingly salvation world the exorcist father karras not misinterpreted commit suicide end rather sacrifices himself save regan possessed girl he catches demon between souls tospeak the omen peck s character mr thorn willing kill only son save world sound biblically familiar these spiritual horror flicks popular reason respect willing sacrifice themselves selflessly others even don t really want perhaps s may think ourselves incapable action like believe take road heroes matters little end religious beliefs t help moved noble nature even reluctant consider george bailey its wonderful life giving benefit consider love appreciation soldiers fight us police firemen equally risk their lives us complete strangers get drift i enjoyed kinds spiritual horror films acted written directed become classics bit reluctant label film classic excellent film holds didn t define genre like others mentioned certainly accomplishes set frightens us appropriate grosses us others it very graphic gets us see worst best humankind may not true classic like the exorcist the omen certainly solid companion films worth spot shelf
